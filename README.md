# Blank Genesis Child Theme

## Summary

This is my personal blank starter theme for use as a child theme of the [Genesis Framework](http://www.studiopress.com/). I use it to build my custom Wordpress themes. It uses (sass)[http://sass-lang.com/] and [CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit/) to compile, minify and handle dependancies. Tested up to WordPress version 4.3.1 and Genesis version 2.2.3 (it will run on older versions of both, but since I'm rebuilding this starter child theme these numbers indicate the current version as of rebuilding).

## Usage

The theme uses sass (sass over scss) for styling and the compiling is handling via CodeKit. If you have CodeKit simply add the child theme folder into codekit and the ```config.codekit``` file will do the rest. If your not using code kit than see the compile list bellow and use whatever system you prefer.

#### Compile:
- sass/style.sass
- sass/
